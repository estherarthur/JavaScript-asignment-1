## üéØ Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of basic JavaScript concepts such as variables, data types and operators.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Getting Started

To get started with this assignment, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and open the folder using VS Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
code .
```

## ‚úÖ Tasks

Please **_do not edit any other file_** except those specified here.
The assignment tasks are as follows:

#### **1. Area of a triangle**

-   In the `areaOfTriangle.js` file, write a JavaScript function that finds the area of a triangle given the lengths of three of its sides. E.g. the sides may be of lengths 5, 6, and 7.
-   The name of your function must be `areaOfTriangle`.
-   The function must take 3 arguments corresponding to the length of one side of the trianle: `a`, `b` and `c`.
-   The function must `return` the area of the triangle.
-   Here's a formula to help you out: [Area of a triangle given 3 sides](https://www.cuemath.com/measurement/area-of-triangle-with-3-sides/)
-   **_Hint:_** Round off to two decimal places. Look up [toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed).

#### **2. Multiplication & Division**

-   In the `multiplicationDivision.js` file, write two JavaScript functions that calculate the multiplication and division of two numbers.
-   The name of your first function must be `multiplication` and the name of the second function must be `division`.
-   The functions must take 2 arguments corresponding to the numbers to be multiplied or divided: `i` and `j`.
-   The `multiplication` function must `return` the product of the 2 numbers passed into it.
-   The `division` function must `return` the quotient of the 2 numbers passed into it.
-   **_Hint:_** Round off to two decimal places. Look up [toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed).

#### **3. Celcius-Fahrenheit Converter**

-   In the `celciusFahrenheit.js` file, write two JavaScript functions that convert temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.
-   The name of your first function must be `celciusToFahrenheit` and the name of the second function must be `fahrenheitToCelcius`.
-   The functions must take one arguments corresponding to the temperature to be converted: `temperature`.
-   The `celciusToFahrenheit` function must `return` the temperature converted from Celcius to Fahrenheit.
-   The `fahrenheitToCelcius` function must `return` the temperature converted from Fahrenheit to Celcius.
-   Here are some formulas to help you out: [Celcius to Fahrenheit](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/temperature/celsius-to-fahrenheit.html) and [Fahrenheit to Celcius](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/temperature/fahrenheit-to-celsius.html)
-   **_Hint:_** Round off to two decimal places. Look up [toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed).

#### **4. Add by One**

-   In the `addByOne.js` file, write a JavaScript function that takes a number and increments its value by one.
-   The name of your function must be `addByOne`.
-   The function must take 1 argument corresponding to the number to be incremented: `number`.
-   The function must `return` the value incremented by 1.

#### **5. True or False?**

-   In the `trueOrFalse.js` file, write a JavaScript function that takes in two numbers and returns true if the sum of both numbers is greater than 100 and returns false otherwise.
-   The name of your function must be `trueOrFalse`.
-   The function must take 2 arguments corresponding to the numbers to be summed up: `m` and `n`.
-   The function must `return` `true` if the sum of the numbers is greater than 100 and `return` `false` otherwise.

### üß™ Testing your code (Optional)

**_Note: You will need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your PC for this to work_**

You can try to test your code before submitting by following the steps outlined below:

-   Run this command in your terminal to install the relevant packages

```bash
npm install
```

-   Run your tests on a specific file

```bash
./tests.sh addByOne.js
```

-   Remember to type in the file name with the `.js` extension.

## ‚úç Submitting Your Assignment
